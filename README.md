this is just a small python code i made in a couple of hours bc i was bored.

this wont work in games like valorant or any other game with enemy highlight
the reaction time of this bot is 50-100ms
idc if you get banned its not my fault you're the one that used it.
i am making a working colorbot for games like valorant it may not be done or maybe it is :)
just check my github profile and if you see "bsm colorbot" thats the colorbot.
code is open source so no it isnt a virus.

you can change how fast the bot detects the color by changing it in the config file.
default is 0.001 or smth idk

to drag the ui just hold the text. it should drag it wherever you want.
have fun and dont get banned!
